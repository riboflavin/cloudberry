<h3>Call for Talks</h3>
<div>
    <p>
            We're looking for talks centered on projects and organizations that are connected with NYC, either in origin or impact, or ideally both. Though we expect many talks to have a technical orientation, one of the objectives of the conference is reaching as diverse an audience as possible. We'd love to hear about:
            <ul style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>How open source is powering your NYC-based company or nonprofit, especially in finance, media, advertising or culture</li>
                <li>How you're using open source with a local impact (e.g. building / operating a NYC-based physical goods factory, organizing a NYC-based community group)</li>
                <li>Discussions of the open source community in NYC, its evolution or impact</li>
                <li>Discussions of state / local policy touching on open source</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
